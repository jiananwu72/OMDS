Below is a suggested modular breakdown with recommendations on what each file should contain. Organizing your project in this way helps keep the concerns separate and facilitates testing each component independently.

──────────────────────────────

main.py
Role:
• Acts as the entry point to your project.
• Coordinates the overall simulation, initiates race detection, and prints or logs the results.

What to include:
• Parse command-line arguments (or use a configuration file) to toggle between different detectors (Naive, SP, SP_hybrid).
• Import modules from OrderMaintenance, NaiveRaceDetector, SP, SP_hybrid (if available), and Simulator.
• Set up a simulation run by generating a simulation tree via Simulator.
• Call the appropriate race detection function(s) and output the results.
• Optionally, include basic timing or logging for performance comparison.

────────────────────────────── 2. OrderMaintenance.py
Role:
• Provides the core data structure and operations for maintaining a linear order (used for English and Hebrew orders).

What to include:
• A class (e.g., OrderMaintenance) with methods such as:

OM_INSERT(new_item, after_item=None): Inserts a new item after a given element (or at the beginning).

OM_PRECEDES(item1, item2): Checks whether item1 comes before item2 in the maintained order.

Helper functions (e.g., for rebalancing or displaying the current ordering).

• Consider adding options for fractional labeling if you plan to support arbitrary insertions without a complete rebalance strategy.
• Unit tests or simple examples within an if __name__ == '__main__': block can be useful for quick verification.

────────────────────────────── 3. NaiveRaceDetector.py
Role:
• Implements a simple sequential race detection mechanism for baseline comparison.
• Processes memory accesses one by one in a sequential execution trace.

What to include:
• A class (e.g., NaiveRaceDetector) that:

Provides methods to log memory accesses (tracking thread ID, variable name, access type, and a timestamp).

Implements a method (detect_races()) that performs pairwise comparisons of accesses to flag data races.
• This file can also include example usages and print-outs of detected races.

────────────────────────────── 4. SP.py
Role:
• Contains the implementation of the “vanilla” SP-order based race detector.
• Uses two instances of your OrderMaintenance module (one for English, one for Hebrew) to determine the SP relationship.

What to include:
• A class or functions that:

Build or simulate the SP parse tree (if not fully delegated to the Simulator) in a sequential (left-to-right) manner.

On-the-fly update the English and Hebrew orders by calling the OM_INSERT operations from OrderMaintenance.

Implement a method (e.g., SP_PRECEDES(u, v)) that checks if one thread precedes another in both orders (and thus determines a race condition if not). • Include pseudocode from the paper as comments to remind yourself of the relationship between S-nodes and P-nodes, and how insertion order differs in each ordering.

────────────────────────────── 5. SP_hybrid.py (Optional)
Role:
• Implements a parallel version of the SP-order approach (SP-hybrid), which adapts the deterministic SP-order ideas to a parallel execution (typically by combining global ordering with local traces).

What to include:
• A class or set of functions that:

Divide execution into “traces” managed on individual processors (or threads) using local data structures (e.g., inspired by SP-bags).

Manage a global SP-order structure to order these traces with minimal synchronization. • Use Python’s threading (or multiprocessing) modules to simulate parallel execution.
• Be mindful of synchronization details (e.g., locks around global data structure updates) and include comments about possible race conditions.
• Since this is optional and more complex, consider building it after you’ve got the vanilla SP detector working well.

────────────────────────────── 6. Simulator.py
Role:
• Generates simulation trees that mimic the SP parse trees observed in fork–join multithreaded programs.
• Provides a controlled environment to test and compare the race detectors.

What to include:
• Functions or a class (e.g., Simulator) that:

Constructs an SP parse tree. The nodes should include leaves (threads) and internal nodes labeled as S-node or P-node.

Optionally randomizes the structure to simulate different types of parallelism.

Exposes methods for traversing the tree such that you can plug the simulation into the SP or Naive race detector. • Example simulation routines:

A simple tree with one fork–join (for a minimal test)

A more complex tree for performance or behavior testing.

────────────────────────────── Final Thoughts
• Each file should ideally be focused on one component.
• Ensure that your modules interact via clearly defined interfaces (e.g., the Simulator should output trees in a structure expected by SP.py and SP_hybrid.py).
• Writing unit tests (even if minimal) in each file will help you verify that components work as expected before integrating them in main.py.

This project structure is modular and expandable. You start with a basic sequential simulation and race detection (NaiveRaceDetector and SP) and can later extend to parallel implementations (via SP_hybrid) as your confidence grows and as you need more performance comparisons.
